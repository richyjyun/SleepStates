# SleepStates

Tracking intracortical signals from the motor cortex of non-human primates via a Utah array for 20-24 hours and classifying brain states between 1) awake and moving, 2) awake and at rest, 3) REM sleep, 4) non-REM sleep. 
Analyzing spike and LFP dynamics throughout each state.

A. Diagram of classification process. LFP and accelerometer signals are used to perform PCA and k-means clustering to determine different sleep states. B. Example of classification and spectra over time.
